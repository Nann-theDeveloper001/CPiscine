# 42 Piscine Program

Welcome to my repository for the 42 Piscine program! This repository contains my solutions to various projects and exercises completed during the 42 Piscine.

## About 42 Piscine

The 42 Piscine is an intensive coding bootcamp-style program offered by 42, a network of tuition-free coding schools. During the Piscine, participants undergo a month-long immersive experience in coding and problem-solving. 

## Projects and Exercises

Throughout the Piscine, participants work on a series of projects and exercises covering a wide range of programming concepts and languages. In this repository, you'll find my solutions to these assignments.

## Contents

- Each project or exercise is contained within its own directory, named accordingly.
- Within each directory, you'll find the source code files (.c, .h, .cpp, etc.) along with any additional resources or instructions.

## Getting Started

To explore my solutions, simply navigate to the directory of the project or exercise you're interested in. You'll find the relevant files along with any necessary instructions or resources.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, study, or even use my solutions as a reference. However, I encourage you to try solving the problems on your own first before consulting my code.

## Contributions

While contributions to this repository are not open to the public, I welcome feedback and suggestions. If you notice any errors or have ideas for improvements, feel free to reach out to me.

Happy coding!
